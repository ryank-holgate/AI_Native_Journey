My AI Native Journey with Pursuit Fellowship
Welcome to my digital space dedicated to my exciting learning adventure with the Pursuit AI Native Fellowship! My name is Ryan Holgate, and I'm thrilled to embark on this journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence.

About This Repository
This repository (AI_Native_Journey) will serve as a central hub for:

All my code projects and assignments from the fellowship.

My notes, insights, and reflections on various AI concepts.

Any valuable resources I discover along the way.

Tracking my progress and milestones throughout the program.

Initial Challenges and Learnings
As a newcomer to this field, setting up my first repository and README.md has been a significant learning experience! Here are some of the initial challenges I've encountered:

Understanding "Repository" Concepts: Initially, grasping what a "repository" actually is and its importance for organizing projects and version control was a bit abstract.

GitHub vs. Local Files: Distinguishing between my project existing online on GitHub.com and the files being stored locally on my computer in Cursor required some mental mapping.

The "Cloning" Process: Learning how to "clone" the repository from GitHub to my local machine using Cursor was a completely new concept, but a crucial step to start working on files.

Markdown Syntax: Getting familiar with Markdown (like using # for headings and ** for bold text) was a fun new syntax to learn for formatting my README.md.

Saving and Syncing (Commit & Push): Understanding that I need to save my changes locally in Cursor and then "commit" and "push" them back to GitHub.com to update the online version is a fundamental workflow I'm now learning.

Each of these steps has been a valuable lesson, and I'm excited to continue overcoming challenges as I progress!

My Goals for the Fellowship
I'm incredibly enthusiastic to dive deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence. Some of my initial goals for the Pursuit AI Native Fellowship include:

Building a strong foundational understanding of AI, Machine Learning, and related technologies.

Developing practical AI applications and projects.

Actively collaborating with my fellow Pursuit scholars and learning from their experiences.

Paving the way for a successful and impactful career in tech.
